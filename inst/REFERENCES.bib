@article{kawakami_thermodynamic_2001,
	title = {Thermodynamic stability of base pairs between 2-hydroxyadenine and incoming nucleotides as a determinant of nucleotide incorporation specificity during replication},
	volume = {29},
	abstract = {We investigated the thermodynamic stability of double-stranded DNAs with an oxidative DNA lesion, 2-hydroxyadenine (2-OH-Ade),
in two different sequence contexts (5'-GA*C-3' and 5'-TA*A-3', A* represents 2-OH-Ade).
When an A*-N pair (N, any nucleotide base) was
located in the center of a duplex, the thermodynamic stabilities
of the duplexes were similar for all the natural bases except A
(N = T, C and G). On the other hand, for the duplexes with
the A*-N pair at the end, which mimic the nucleotide
incorporation step, the stabilities of the duplexes were dependent
on their sequence. The order of stability is T {>} G {>} C {>}{>} A
in the 5'-GA*C-3' sequences
and T {>} A {>} C {>} G in the 5'-TA*A-3' sequences. Because T/G/C
and T/A are nucleotides incorporated opposite to 2-OH-Ade
in the 5'-GA*C-3' and
5'-TA*A-3' sequences,
respectively, these results agree with the tendency of mutagenic
misincorporation of the nucleotides opposite to 2-OH-Ade in
vitro. Thus, the thermodynamic stability of the A*-N
base pair may be an important factor for the mutation spectra of
2-OH-Ade.},
